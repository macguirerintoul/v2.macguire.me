      <h2>Brief</h2>
      <p>LeadRx is a Vancouver Coastal Health initiative to encourage managers to take five minutes per day to become more confident in their positions. The LeadRx app is a repository for professional development content to support this initative. The app was originally created before I was hired, and I was tasked with redesigning the interface and implementing the changes.</p>
